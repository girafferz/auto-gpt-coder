It seems like you have a method in your 'sample' class called "execute", but it's not implemented (maybe even abstract). You're trying to call it in your test and it throws an error as it's not yet implemented. 

The simplest solution to this problem would be to implement the method, at least with some simple functionality for now, and to update it as necessary when more specific functionality becomes required. 

This is what Jest is pointing to when it throws 'TypeError: Sample.execute is not a function'. To solve this issue, you could potentially modify your TypeScript class to something like this:

```ts
class Sample {
  public execute(): void {
    console.log('Method is implemented.');
  }
}
```
That will prevent jest from failing on "Method not implemented" error.
Now, if you run the tests again jest should go over this issue and if there are more issues in your code, it will show them (or pass if there are none).
