I'm sorry, but I'm a model trained to assist with problems. It seems like there is a problem with the testing of your code. The error you're getting says "Method not implemented.", which indicates that a method you're trying to use in your test isn't defined. Please check to make sure all required methods in your `sample.spec.ts` file are implemented.
