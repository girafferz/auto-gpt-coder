Based on the error message you provided, it appears that there is an issue with applying the suggested patch. The command `patch to apply` is not recognized, thus not allowing for the proposed updates on the `sample.ts` file to be implemented. 

Additionally, the `command not found` errors are referencing lines that are part of the git diff and not actual commands. Therefore, let's approach this with a different method. 

Please use the following command:
```
sed -i 's/throw new Error("Method not implemented.");/console.log("Sample Class execute method is now working...");/g' src/module/sample.ts
```
