The error seems to arise from a test failing in the `sample.spec.ts` test suite. Specifically, a method you need to implement is throwing a "Method not implemented" error within the `Sample` class and this is causing your test suite to fail.

Here is the details:

1. Test suite file path: `specs/sample.spec.ts`
2. Error is thrown at line 5 in the `Sample.execute` method from your `src/module/sample.ts` file.

To solve this:

- You should implement the needed method in your `Sample` class. For example, if the method that required implementation is `execute`, make sure that it is correctly implemented.
- Make sure the test for the `execute` method in your `sample.spec.ts` test file is working as expected.

These changes should help fix the test failure.
