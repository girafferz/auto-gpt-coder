To provide context to the issue, it seems that the error is occurring because there's an unimplemented method in the sample.ts module. As a result, the automatic tests are failing.

The error is depicted in this portion of the output:

```bash
sample â€º should run tests and process errors

Method not implemented.

5 |     throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
```

The "Method not implemented" error is being thrown inside the "execute" function of the Sample module.

The error can be fixed by implementing the expected functionality inside the "execute" function or, if the function is a placeholder, comment out or remove the line that throws the error while the function is not completed.

Let me know what the next steps should be.
