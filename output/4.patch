The error message indicates that a method has not been implemented in your code which is causing your tests to fail. Here's the relevant portion of the error: 

```bash
sample â€º should run tests and process errors

Method not implemented.

5 |     throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
```

This indicates that a function or method in your 'sample.spec.ts' file is throwing a "Method not implemented." error. Check your 'sample.spec.ts' file to see what method it could be referring to. Without more context it's hard to be more specific, but you need to find out where this error is being thrown and implement the missing functionality in order for your tests to pass.
