I apologize for the confusion earlier. The error messages indicate that there's an unimplemented method in the `sample` module that the `sample.spec.ts` test is trying to execute. 

```
Method not implemented.

5 |     throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
```

This `Method not implemented.` error is thrown on line 5 of `src/module/sample.ts`:

```
3 |
4 |   execute() {
5 |     throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
6 |   }
7 | }
```

The method `execute` in the `Sample` class only throws a `Method not implemented.` error. This is why the `should run tests and process errors` test in `specs/sample.spec.ts` is failing.

To resolve this error, you will need to implement the `execute` method in the `Sample` class in `src/module/sample.ts`.

Please let me know if you need any additional assistance.
